Facelooks is open source and web-based, yet almost all images are stored on the local hard drive. Facelooks' basic features let you navigate a tree of folders and image files using the arrow keys. Bottom-level folders let you display images in a grid. Clicking on the grid expands the image to full-screen.\r\n\r\n## Advanced Features\r\n\r\n1. Play videos\r\n1. Combine up to 3 images on one slide\r\n1. Modify image ordering in grid\r\n1. Access bookmark list\r\n1. Tag images\r\n1. Magnify images (zoom in)\r\n1. Use URL builder to access web addresses which contain facelooker name\r\n1. Use URL builder to step through a numbered list of images\r\n\r\n## Basic Features\r\n\r\n1. Folder List\r\n\r\n        Left/Right: select  \r\n        Up: parent folder list  \r\n        Down/Enter: grid  \r\n        Click: grid  \r\n\r\n1. Grid of Images\r\n\r\n        Left/Right: previous/next grid  \r\n        Up: folder list  \r\n        Down/Enter: mono (current image)  \r\n        Click: mono  \r\n\r\n1.

Clicking on any of the 3 images removes it. Clicking on white space toggles the display of a gray rectangle. Whenever a gray rectangle has been activated (displayed), and then an image other than the current slide is displayed and clicked on, the current slide is displayed and the image clicked on replaces the gray rectangle.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
