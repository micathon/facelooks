Image Collection Manager is written in Python and uses Flask

Facelooks lets you manage your image collection, is written in Python, and requires a free tool called Flask (its database is SQLite which is bundled with Python). Facelooks is open source and web-based, yet almost all images are stored on the local hard drive. Facelooks' basic features let you navigate a tree of folders and image files using the arrow keys. Bottom-level folders let you display images in a grid. Clicking on the grid expands the image to full-screen.
