# picrolyte
This Picrolyte project is the prototype of a more ambitious project (the full version) which attempts to monetize Picrolyte functionality. The full version is no longer under development. To launch Protolyte, visit localhost:6996 in your browser after running its Python script.

Images are displayed in either a grid (defaults to 3 rows by 6 columns) or a single large image. The image grids corresponding to the tapes in the database are called grid outers. The grids corresponding to rows are called grid inners. The grids corresponding to "$" subfolders of rows are called grid cores. Row names beginning with an underscore are ignored. The user's local Dropbox folder is an ancestor folder of the root folder of all rows. To launch Picrotapes, visit localhost:5000 in your browser.
