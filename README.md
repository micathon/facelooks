# picrotapes
Picrotapes.com is an open source (completely free) web-based image sharing tool written in Python, which makes use of Flask and Dropbox. Every image is stored in either an image folder (called a row, which may contain multiple images) or a folder named "$" contained in an image folder. All rows are stored in tapes. The Picrotapes database contains a list of tapes.

Images are displayed in either a grid (defaults to 3 rows by 6 columns) or a single large image. The image grids corresponding to the tapes in the database are called grid outers. The grids corresponding to rows are called grid inners. The grids corresponding to "$" subfolders of rows are called grid cores. Row names beginning with an underscore are ignored. The user's local Dropbox folder is an ancestor folder of the root folder of all rows. To launch Picrotapes, visit localhost:5000 in your browser.
