# randeepic
Randeepic.com is an open source (completely free) web-based image sharing tool written in Python, which makes use of Flask and Dropbox. Every image is stored in either an image folder or a folder named "$" contained in an image folder. All image folders are stored in superfolders. The superlist contains a list of superfolders. If the 1st superfolder in that list contains a folder called "$", then a 2nd superfolder exists in the superlist. If the 2nd superfolder contains a folder called "$", then a 3rd superfolder exists in the superlist, and so on.

Images are displayed in either a grid (defaults to 3 rows by 6 columns) or a single large image. The image grids corresponding to the superfolders in the superlist are called grid outers. The grids beneath image folders are called grid inners. The grids beneath "$" subfolders of image folders are called grid cores. Image folder names beginning with an underscore are ignored. The user's local Dropbox folder is an ancestor folder of the root folder of all image folders.
